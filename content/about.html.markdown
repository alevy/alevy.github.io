In 2009 I graduated from the University of Washington with a B.S. in Computer Science and Economics (double major). Since then I've continued towards a 5th year masters also at the UW, where I work with [Hank Levy][], [Tadayoshi Kohno][], [Arvind Krishnamurthy][], and [Roxana Geambasu][] on web privacy and distributed systems. I've interned at Google once developing distributed testing tools and again building tools to help developers schedule their cluster jobs. Before that I worked at the [Grameen Foundation][] as an intern on the [MIFOS][] (<b>M</b>icros <b>F</b>inance <b>O</b>pen <b>S</b>ource) project. This fall I will be applying to PhD programs in computer science for Fall 2011.
