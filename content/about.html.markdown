## About

![In the spotlight!](images/profile.jpg "Profile")

In September 2011 I joined the Computer Science PhD program at Stanford University. Currently I work with [David Mazi√®res][] in the [Secure Computer Systems][] group on projects mostly TBD. I'm generally interested in distributed systems security, privacy, distributed storage and good will towards people.

In December 2010 I graduated from the University of Washington with an MSc in Computer Science and a BSc in Computer Science and Economics (double major). I worked with [Hank Levy][], [Tadayoshi Kohno][], [Arvind Krishnamurthy][], and [Roxana Geambasu][] on web privacy and distributed systems. I've interned at Google, once developing distributed testing tools and again building tools to help developers schedule their cluster jobs. Before that I worked at the [Grameen Foundation][] as an intern on the [MIFOS][] (<b>M</b>icros <b>F</b>inance <b>O</b>pen <b>S</b>ource) project.

Between UW and Stanford I sat at [StartPad](http://www.startpad.org), a co-working space in Seattle, where I hacked on projects with my friend [Courtlandt Stanton][]{:rel="friend co-worker"} for [fun](http://github.com/alevy) and [profit](http://www.groundflooranalytics.com).
