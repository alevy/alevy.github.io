I'm a terminal year Computer Science PhD student at Stanford University. I work
with [David Mazi√®res] in the [Secure Computer Systems] group and [Phil Levis]
in the [Stanford Information Networks Group].

My partner-in-crime, [Kaitlin Morrison], is doing a fellowship at the Natural
Resource Defense Council in New York. So, while I'm still a student at
Stanford, I live and sometimes work in New York.

I'm currently working on a new secure operating system for embedded devices
called [TockOS](http://www.tockos.org). I also work on
[Hails](http://hails.scs.stanford.edu), a framework for building secure web
platforms and Beetle, a network architecture for Bluetooth Low Energy.

I'm generally interested in distributed systems, operating systems, security,
privacy, programming languages and good will towards people.

In another life, I work on [MemCachier](http://www.memcachier.com) -
memcache-as-a-service for web applications hosted on platforms like
[Heroku](http://www.heroku.com), [cloudControl](http://www.cloudcontrol.com) or
directly on [EC2](http://aws.amazon.com). I do not generally recommended
starting a business while in grad school, but if you have to -- and sometimes
you have to -- I highly recommend doing it with pleasant people, like [Lindsey
Jacks], Ian Ross, [Sascha Trifunovic] and my co-conspirator [David Terei].

If you want a job that involves interacting with human begins, programming in Go
and Haskell, running a distributed storage system and relatively little work,
please contact me.

## Background

In December 2010 I graduated from the University of Washington with an MSc in
Computer Science and a BSc in Computer Science and Economics.

On the computer science side of things, I worked with [Roxana Geambasu], [Hank
Levy], [Tadayoshi Kohno] and [Arvind Krishnamurthy] on web privacy and
distributed systems. On the economics side of things I worked on writing exams
with as little preparation as possible. In hind sight I should have taken
classes in something useful, like history, instead.

Between UW and Stanford I sat at [StartPad](http://www.startpad.org), a
co-working space in Seattle, where I worked on projects with my friend
Courty Stanton for [fun](#code) and profit.

I've interned at Google (a popular surveillance system and search engine),
once developing distributed testing tools and again building tools to help
developers schedule their cluster jobs. Before that I worked at the [Grameen
Foundation][] as an intern on the [MIFOS][] (**M**icros **F**inance **O**pen
**S**ource) project. Before that, I spent my summers as a day-camp counselor at
a performing arts camp.

Once, I met [Eben Moglen](http://moglen.law.columbia.edu/) and he asked me if I
worked for Mossad, which seems like a silly question to ask someone you think
might work for Mossad.
