![The perfect skipping rock](images/profile.jpg "Profile")

In December 2010 I graduated from the University of Washington with an MSc in Computer Science and a BSc in Computer Science and Economics (double major). I worked with [Hank Levy][], [Tadayoshi Kohno][], [Arvind Krishnamurthy][], and [Roxana Geambasu][] on web privacy and distributed systems. I've interned at Google, once developing distributed testing tools and again building tools to help developers schedule their cluster jobs. Before that I worked at the [Grameen Foundation][] as an intern on the [MIFOS][] (<b>M</b>icros <b>F</b>inance <b>O</b>pen <b>S</b>ource) project. In September I'll move to the bay area to start a PhD program in Computer Science at Stanford. In the meantime I've been sitting at [StartPad](http://www.startpad.org), a co-working space, where I hack on projects with my friend [Courtlandt Stanton][]{:rel="friend co-worker"} for [fun](http://github.com/alevy) and [profit](http://www.groundflooranalytics.com).
