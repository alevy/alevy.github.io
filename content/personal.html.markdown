## Personal

_**UPDATE**: I moved to the bay area in September, so this page is pretty out of date (particularly the part about any of the people listed below being my friends). I plan on adding more current details as soon as I develop a personality._

When I'm not hacking on software, I might be playing guitar or piano, planning my next escape (see travel below), or enjoying the wonderful [coffee](http://www.herkimercoffee.com/), [food](http://www.yelp.com/biz/kingfish-cafe-seattle) and [beer](http://www.yelp.com/biz/brouwers-cafe-seattle) that Seattle has to offers. I like any and all water sports (including floating) and also try to hike or ski as much as possible. I used to [row](http://www.gohuskies.com/sports/c-crew/mtt/levy_amit00.html), but now I mostly use faster methods of transportation.
