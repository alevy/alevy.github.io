I'm an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science department at Princeton University.

Until recently, I was working with [David Mazi√®res] in the [Secure Computer Systems]
group and [Phil Levis] in the [Stanford Information Networks Group].

I'm generally interested in distributed systems, operating systems, security,
privacy, programming languages and good will towards people. I'm currently
spending most of time working on a new secure operating system for low-memory
microcontrollers called [TockOS](http://www.tockos.org).

Way back when, in December 2010 I graduated from the University of Washington
with an MSc in Computer Science and a BSc in Computer Science and Economics.
On the computer science side of things, I worked with [Roxana Geambasu], [Hank
Levy], [Tadayoshi Kohno] and [Arvind Krishnamurthy] on web privacy and
distributed systems. On the economics side of things I worked on writing exams
with as little preparation as possible. In hind sight I should have taken
classes in something useful instead. Maybe history.
