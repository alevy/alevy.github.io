Hi. My name is Amit, and I build systems.

~~I'm an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science department at Princeton
University, where I lead the Praxis lab and co-lead the [SNS
group](https://sns.cs.princeton.edu).~~

My research centers around the idea that well designed secure systems _empower_
developers and their applications, rather than restrict them. This usually
manifests in building practical and secure operating systems, embedded systems,
distributed systems, and often leverages tools from programming languages.

## PhD Students

Until September 2025, I was a professor at Princeton University and have stayed
on as a visiting research scholar so I can continue to advise my wonderful PhD
students:
