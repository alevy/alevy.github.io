Hi. My name is Amit, and I build systems.

I'm an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science department at Princeton
University, where I'm affiliated with the [SNS
group](https://sns.cs.princeton.edu).

My research centers around the idea that well designed secure systems _empower_
developers and their applications, rather than restrict them. This usually
manifests in building practical and secure operating systems, embedded systems,
distributed systems, and often leverages tools from programming languages.

I'm currently hacking mostly on [Tock](https://tockos.org), a secure operating
system for low-resource (think 64kB of RAM) Internet of Things devices, and
using operating system schedulers to eliminate timing channels. But if you can
fit "extensible", "secure", and "system" into a sentence you have my
attention.
