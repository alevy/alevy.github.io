I'm a Computer Science PhD student at Stanford University. I work with [David
Mazi√®res] in the [Secure Computer Systems] group and [Phil Levis] in the
[Stanford Information Networks Group].

I'm generally interested in distributed systems, operating systems, security,
privacy, programming languages and good will towards people. I'm currently
spending most of time working on a new secure operating system for low-memory
microcontrollers called [TockOS](http://www.tockos.org).

In another life, I work on [MemCachier](http://www.memcachier.com) -
memcache-as-a-service for web applications hosted on platforms like
[Heroku](http://www.heroku.com). I do not generally recommended
starting a business while in grad school, but if you have to -- and sometimes
you have to -- I highly recommend doing it with pleasant people, like [Lindsey
Jacks], Ian Ross, [Sascha Trifunovic] and my co-conspirator [David Terei].

My partner-in-crime, [Kaitlin Morrison], is doing a fellowship at the Natural
Resources Defense Council in New York. So, while I'm still a student at
Stanford, I live and sometimes work in New York.

Way back when, in December 2010 I graduated from the University of Washington
with an MSc in Computer Science and a BSc in Computer Science and Economics.
On the computer science side of things, I worked with [Roxana Geambasu], [Hank
Levy], [Tadayoshi Kohno] and [Arvind Krishnamurthy] on web privacy and
distributed systems. On the economics side of things I worked on writing exams
with as little preparation as possible. In hind sight I should have taken
classes in something useful instead. Maybe history.

I interned at Google (a popular surveillance system and search engine),
once developing distributed testing tools, again building tools to help
developers schedule their cluster jobs, and yet again port Tock to an internal
platform. Before that I worked at the [Grameen Foundation][] as an intern on
the [MIFOS][] (**M**icros **F**inance **O**pen **S**ource) project. Before
I knew how to code I was a day-camp counselor at a performing arts camp.

Once, I met [Eben Moglen](http://moglen.law.columbia.edu/) and he asked me if I
worked for Mossad, which seems like a silly question to ask someone you think
might work for Mossad.
