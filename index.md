Hi. My name is Amit, and I build systems.

I'm an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science department at Princeton
University, where I lead the Praxis lab and co-lead the [SNS
group](https://sns.cs.princeton.edu).

My research centers around the idea that well designed secure systems _empower_
developers and their applications, rather than restrict them. This usually
manifests in building practical and secure operating systems, embedded systems,
distributed systems, and often leverages tools from programming languages.

If you are a Princeton undergraduate interested in research or looking for a
thesis/IW advisor, a prospective PhD student, or a colleague trying to sound
like you've kept up with my work before seeing me, consider looking at a summary
of my current and recent [projects](/research).
